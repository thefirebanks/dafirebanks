When I saw my friend Aryan's [personal website](https://aryanmann.com/), I got inspired to ~~fork his repository and stamp my name on it~~ have my own. 
One of my big goals for this year is to start sharing more - in the broad sense of that word, whether that is through writing, music, photography, code... anything. 

This blog will contribute to that goal. While initially I was excited to write about things that I learn in my AI research journey, the truth is that I (*as most humans do*) have thoughts about a lot of different things that aren't AI related.
So I'll write about those too, and we'll see where this goes. Hell, my first 10 posts may not be about anything technical at all, since every time I feel motivated to write my brain is not in that headspace. Regardless, hopefully you can find something that makes you think, learn, feel, laugh, or just relate to. 

**Disclaimer:** I am not a good + fast writer. My best pieces of writing have originated from a lot of editing, pondering, and going back and forth on minor details. 
I won't take that approach here. Since the main goal is to share more, I will give myself a deadline by which I'll have to post something, and then upload what I have, otherwise I have to send money to my friends.

Wish me luck!
