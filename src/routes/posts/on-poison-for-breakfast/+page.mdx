I recently finished a book by one of my favorite authors from when I was younger - Lemony Snicket. 
He wrote A Series of Unfortunate Events, a quintessential piece of literature in my English-learning journey.
I love his writing style. It's witty, filled with double entendres, and with a great balance between going on tangents and getting you back in the story. 
It's as if a good friend, who's much older than you, is sitting with you and telling you his wildest annecdotes, rather than you reading something from a book. 
These are children's books written for adults, so there are a lot of observations about the nature of people hidden in the stories that you only grasp as you age.  
  
When I heard about a more recent book of his - Poison for Breakfast - I was certain I would enjoy it. 
It was even marketed as a pseudo-philosophical book, which comes a a good time since I am revisiting an old interest in philosophy. 
The book is about **TODO: Write book summary**

I ended up being mostly disappointed :( the metaphors felt shallow, the tangents were not as bewildering, and the story felt more predictable than magical. 
The ending was still a surprise and filled with "takeaways" about the process of thinking and writing books. 
Yet it just sounded flat, and I didn't feel touched by the narrative. 

I wonder whether it's partly a combination of my own growing up plus some unsaid expectations, and I felt sad about the possibility of losing a piece of my childlike wonder that this author used to bring up in me. 
sI'm obviously different now than when I read these books years ago, and yet every reminder of my increased adulthood is both satisfying and painful if it comes with some loss of innocence.
