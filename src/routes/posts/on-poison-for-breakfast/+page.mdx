I recently finished a book by one of my favorite authors from when I was younger - Lemony Snicket. 
He wrote A Series of Unfortunate Events, a quintessential piece of literature in my English-learning journey.
I love his writing style. It's witty, filled with double entendres, and with a great balance between going on tangents and getting you back in the story. 
It's as if a good friend, who's much older than you, is sitting with you and telling you his wildest annecdotes, rather than you reading something from a book. 
These are children's books written for adults, so there are a lot of observations about the nature of people hidden in the stories that you only grasp as you age.  

When I heard about a more recent book of his - Poison for Breakfast - I was certain I would enjoy it. 
It was even marketed as a pseudo-philosophical book, which comes at a good time since I am revisiting an old interest in philosophy. 
From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56769614-poison-for-breakfast): 

> "This true story—as true as Lemony Snicket himself—begins with a puzzling note under his door: You had poison for breakfast. Following a winding trail of clues to solve the mystery of his own demise, Snicket takes us on a thought-provoking tour of his predilections: the proper way to prepare an egg, a perplexing idea called “tzimtzum,” the sublime pleasure of swimming in open water, and much else."

Well, of course I was invested in finding out who poisoned this man during breakfast, one of the most peaceful and innocent times of the day. Also, based on how long the story takes, what kind of poison takes such a non-debilitating, slow approach to killing you? But I digress. 

I listened to the audiobook. Narrated by Patrick Warbuton, I couldn't recommend listening to him enough. 
Yet while the narration was a pleasure to the ears, I ended up mostly disappointed with the novel. 
*Pros:* It contains both completely unnecessary facts about egg preparation and interesting thoughts on death, writing books, and philosophy. 
Maybe even a surprise ending. *Cons:* The metaphors felt shallow, the tangents were not as bewildering, and the flow of the story was a bit flat. 
It was more predictable than magical.


Magical, I guess, is what I was looking for. 
Some semblance of surprise that would make me get into another world where ridiculousness is the norm, but familiar enough with our reality so that I can laugh at the ridiculousness of ours. 
If it's not surprising anymore, have I grown too old? Is that good enough of a reason to not enjoy one of favorite writers like I used to?
I felt sad about the possibility of losing a piece of the childlike wonder this author used to bring up in me. 
People change, I know. I'm obviously different now than when I was when I read these books years ago, and yet every reminder of my increased adulthood is both satisfying and painful if it comes with some loss of innocence.
