If not the act of consciously doing what you know you should be doing already. Excerpts from *Consolations* by David Whyte that I have found helpful more than once:

> "From its origins, the old Norman French *Coeur*: Heart... To be courageous is not necessarily to go anywhere or do anything except to make conscious those things we already feel deeply, and then to live through the unending vulnerabilities of those consequences."

> "Courage is what loves looks like when tested by the simple everyday necessities of being alive... To be courageous is to stay close to the way we are made."


We tend to think that external factors push us to be courageous, but Whyte reminds us that internal yearnings are the true main drivers:

> "We become courageous whenever we live closely and to the point of tears with any new possibility made known inside us, whenever we demonstrate a faith in the new interior annunciations and align ourselves with the new and surprising and heartfelt necessities of even the average existence."

> "... only slowly do we learn what we really care about, and allow our outer life to be realigned in that gravitational pull... that robust vulnerability comes to feel like the only necessary way forward... on the inside, we come to know who and what and how we love and what we can do to deepen that love; only from the outside and only by looking back, does it look like courage."

 Then, to be courageous is to listen to the old and new desires of the heart and let oneself be vulnerable and faithful to them. To act with conviction about the things and people we already know we love, and to live the experience deeply and consciously.


Courage is breaking from the fears that you've been carrying for generations.

To define what is worth being afraid of, in your own terms.

To meet a distant friend who only comes during the times you need to remember that it's a privilege to be alive.
