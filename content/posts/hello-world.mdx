I have gone through about about six or seven iterations of my personal website and all of them have just one blog post.
Sometimes I got lucky and actually wrote something tangible (like a post about a Kafka reading I did in college) and other times it was just a plain old "hello world." Couple of them were also 
a metacommentary on this very behavior.. although this is the first time going meta meta. 

There might be something here one day..
